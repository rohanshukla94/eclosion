<p align="center">This is my attempt to create a web framework in Golang.
    <br> 
    What I built: ‚ÄúEclosion is a lightweight starter for Go web apps that standardizes sessions, rendering, routing, and env‚Äëbased configuration. It lets me switch between Jet and Go templates, and swap session backends (cookie/Redis/Postgres) based on environment.‚Äù

    Key design choices:

    Chi for composable middleware and lean router.

    SCS for secure session handling with pluggable stores.

    Jet for fast, expressive templating + optional fallback to stdlib.

    Reliability: Centralized logging, Recoverer middleware, configurable timeouts on the server.
</p>

### Todo

- [ ] finish session stores,
- [ ] add CSRF and Static Serving
- [ ] fixing config pitfalls
- [ ] small simple auth feature to demo sessions and templates
